ROS for LabVIEW(TM) Software
----------------------------------

This is a set of VIs for communicating with ROS applications. Developed at Tufts University by the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach. Currently in beta.

ROSforLV should be installed in your "LabVIEW > user.lib" folder (Under applications in Mac OS X and program files in Windows). LabVIEW will need to restart after installing the library.
